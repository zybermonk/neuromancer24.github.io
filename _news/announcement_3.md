Definitely not to 'work' and be 'productive'. It should be somewhat inclined towards creativity and exploration. Read this short article where I've found an approach to accelerate the species towards achieving its purpose!

A digital superintelligence! is it just an irrational fideism? or maybe the prophecies/conspiracies have a significant error in their arguments?

I formulated a hypothesis earlier this year to check the possibility of creating an 'artificial general intelligence' at some point in the human lifetime. The study focused on the limitations set on investment ability, software complexity and hardware advancements with an apriori expectation that believed it was indeed possible to create AGI components and even intelligent systems, however with a very low probability! The inevitable observation always led to an event of 'intelligence explosion' as soon as a strong AGI was (IF) created.

As I look forward to continuing my journey with AI in the industry, I am revisiting this research to extract ideas towards building general applicable AI components and systems that can cascade into useful collateral damage reshaping the world. The utopian ideology involves developments in realizing ultimate human potential by giving the population freedom of creativity where the general AI could take the workload of mundane day-to-day admin tasks. The possibilities are boundless, from protecting privacy, flawless surveillance, sustainable transport, efficient housing, better energy consumption (even generation), curing deadly diseases, creating an entirely new economy, to ultimately paving a pathway to a better, healthy, and abundant living experience for the human species.

This modified approach to my study is more interesting as any development will result in positive prompts that are usable by humans or create more traction in an industry setting. Moreover, governing the process of creating AGI can have the capacity to regulate it as well.

Hence, I invite anyone reading this post to provide as many counter-arguments as possible so that new approaches can emerge to eventually achieve creative human freedom and accelerate the process of making a conscious AI possible

Especially on digital spaces like LinkedIn, where we can see a lot of career-driven high calibre individuals, ‘why start-up’ is a question which most of you will answer with some definition by yourselves. So, we will revisit this question later on in subsequent articles. However, ‘why squat’ might be a relatively newer question as a majority of this community probably is not squatting!  

A high number of individuals in white-collar jobs either “go to the gym” or indulge in some kind of physical activity such as ‘running’, ‘walking the dog’, ‘playing soccer in a local Sunday league, etc. But how many of these individuals are truly fit and healthy? preferably with an aesthetic physique (low body fat + high muscle mass)  and a high-functioning lifestyle full of energy? The answer is almost nobody. Although everyone wants to look good and feel good, if you say/believe that you are happy with the way you look/feel and still are not a 10/10 version of yourself, you are just lying to yourself.  

Having said that, if you are happy with everything, good for you, but you can be better. ‘Happiness’ is temporary, ‘excitement’ can be constant! So, if you are ready to change the way you feel, look, perform, learn and create, start following this series where I have sourced all the information you need  in actionable short tasks/habits from fitness to diet/nutrition, to lifestyle, to technology, to business and much more…

**Squat: The king of exercises** is not just sitting down and getting up, it represents putting your muscles under tension and shocking your body in order to grow and ignite the proper production/function of hormones in your body. In general, it represents lifting weights! No matter what your goals are, be it losing fat, gaining muscle, performing well in life, or looking good in clothes, and without, you have to lift weights. It is a fundamental necessity like brushing your teeth, taking a shower, or even eating food.  

One can argue that any kind of physical activity is enough to keep your body fit and healthy, agreed, anyone can be fit and healthy when they clean their diet and exercise. But, being fit and healthy is a baseline for humans. We are supposed to be fit and healthy, nothing great in that, it is borderline average. What this series talks about is, beating mediocrity and reaching the natural highs one can possibly experience in all aspects of life. Isn’t it exciting to enjoy everything to the fullest? damn, right it is!  

> Disclaimer: Body positivity is totally fine. People who are below the baseline and are struggling must be encouraged and included. This series focuses especially on the majority of borderline fit+healthy people which in general most people ages 20 -40 are.

Sounds good eh? But why haven’t most of you been lifting weights? In general, the main reason would be ‘not enough time with busy schedules, and other reasons would be that lifting weights doesn’t seem as fun as some of the other physical activities such as playing a sport. Some might even think lifting weights is harmful, scary, and makes them look big like a muscular gym bro ( a fear especially common among female prospects).  

Overall, what’s happening is a lack of basic knowledge on the subject and a lot of stunts and gimmicks in the fitness industry that takes advantage of people working 9-5 to subscribe to ridiculous programs and advise fancy regimen which is fundamentally unfollowable for a significant amount of time to achieve results. But the most common mistake everyone makes is thinking that they will focus on fitness after they’ve achieved certain things first, like completing college, getting a job, finishing certain tasks/events, etc., and end up never starting their journey into fitness. On the other hand, focusing on fitness first actually speeds up every other goal in life. It also makes the journey to success much more enjoyable and stress-free.  

Wondering how to start?

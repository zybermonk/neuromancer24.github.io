# Abstract
The study is focused on the effects of technological progress on economic growth in advanced countries over the past 130 years; Data was gathered for advanced countries over the given period, these countries have been chosen for their economic relevance. 1) G7 nations 2) A collective of European nations grouped as Euro in 2010, with 93.2% of the Euro Area GDP. The related variables simulated were GDP per capita, capital intensity, and labour productivity using the well known Cobb-Douglas Production function; After being transformed into valid econometric models, the established theoretical models were empirically checked; This study found out that increase in technology resulted in an economic growth. Furthermore, the effects of capital input and labour input are also briefly examined.  

**Keywords:** Economic growth; Technology; Productivity; advanced countries

# 1. Introduction 
The thesis is useful on a quantitative basis because it sought to model the real level of technology by separating other factors from the "remaining value”. (Bekar et al. 2018). Totalfactor productivity is the term most widely used by economists (TFP), which is also generally known as “remaining value” or “residual value”(Kenton 2000). The difference betweenthe proportional change in output and the proportional change in a Divisa index of inputs is known as total factor productivity. Solow's "remaining value," according to Liu Sifeng (Yuan et al. 2009), reflects the contribution of all variables in the Cobb-Douglas production function except fund and labour to output ratio. Hence, the study looks at technology factor separately from the “remaining value” and estimates its effects on economic growth. Furthermore, the report contends on a brief examination, that increases in either labour or capital productivity led to a fall in economic development(Alani 2012). According to the report, this is attributed to an increase in leisure use after an increase in either capital or labour productivity, since people prefer to trade off leisure for jobs as their incomes grow.

# 2. Research Objectives
- Analysis of the impact of the level of technology on economic development in advanced countries during the aforementioned period.
- To test the separation of the amount of technological advancement from the "remaining value" or TFP.
- Checking whether the technology progress has the same effect across the 2 groups of aforementioned countries.
- Brief examination of capital and labour inputs.

# 3. Literature Review
The literature review focuses on estimating the impact of technological advancement on economic development. Following the study, a new paradigm connecting technical innovation and labour and capital productivity is created. conomists like (Carlaw and Lipsey 2003) suggest that the total factor productivity is often interpreted as the technological progress and which in turn promotes economic growth. However, there seems to be a major error in measuring the technology factor from the TFP as a whole. (Hulten 2001) identified that the various factors contributing to the TFP are not measured individually but grouped together as a residual or “remaining value”. In particular, there is an increasing body of literature demonstrating that productivity growth is not an indicator of technical progress (Gordon 2000). As a result, TFP is a deceptive definition of productivity because: (a) a critical analysis of the Cobb-Douglas production function reveals that typical TFP exceeds real TFP by an amount equal to the growth in output. (b) the majority of economists who write about total factor productivity, It's possible that they didn't bother differentiating it from the level of technology or the technology factor (Alani 2012). Furthermore, most economists, like (Casetti and Jones 1983) and (Hornstein and Krusell 1996), believe that increased productivity leads to ncreased economic growth. Theoretical models derived from the Cobb-Douglas output function, such as the one described in this study, seem to extend support to this belief. 

## 3.1. Model Background
The Cobb-Douglas production function, as advanced by Knut Wicksell (Edward Elgar 2021) and statistically evaluated to provide proof by Paul Douglas and Charles Cobb in 1928 (Cobb and Douglas 1928), is the most commonly used in economics to describe the relationship between output and inputs.

$$ 
𝑌 = 𝐴𝐾^𝛼𝐿^𝛽 
$$

𝑊ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑌 = 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡, 𝐴 = 𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑛𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 ,𝐾 = 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡, 𝐿 = 𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 

In the above equation the α and β are constants that are determined by technology. Whereas, in macroeconomic modelling, the Cobb-Douglas output function is given by,

$$
𝑄 = 𝐾^𝛼𝐿^ {1−𝛼}
$$

𝑊ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑄 = 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡,𝐾 = 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 , 𝐿 = 𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑟 73

This equation is first order homogenous as the returns to scale is constant (Cobb and Douglas 1928). A constant returns to scale tells us that the output will increase proportional to the increase in all the input variables by the ame factor (Peston 1960). However, in this study we modify the above equation to model the technology factor and estimate its effects. Now, the equation becomes

$$
𝑌 = 𝐴^𝜆𝐾^𝛼𝐿^𝛽
$$

Here, the returns -to-scale is given by `𝛾 = 𝜆 + 𝛼 + 𝛽`

We shall use this returns to scale metric in further sections to validate our hypothesis in this study. We see, if we are getting a constant returns to scale, and increase in returns to scale or a decrease in returns to scale. In hindsight, we are looking at a macro economics of scale for advanced nations (Investopedia 2014). 

## 3.2. Model of technological progress
Tinbergen's improved Cobb-Douglas output function (TINBERGEN 1964) is often used to measure the contribution of technical innovation to economic development. Solow's "remaining benefit," according to Liu Sifeng, reflects the ontribution of all variables but capital and labour to the production ratio (Yuan et al. 2009). However, Liu Sifeng claims that the approach has some significant flaws that make it impossible to make accurate predictions in a realistic analysis. This is because a variety of random factors influence production growth, contributing to an overestimation of technological growth factor. (Liu et al. 2009) went on to distinguish the influences of other causes from the “remaining value” in order to achieve a more accurate estimate of technological progress. However, their method does not consider the direct effect of technological progress. It only estimates the time variation of technological progress (Alani 2012). Hence, the modified equation mentioned above will be a good consideration for our study. 

## 3.3. Initial assumptions
The current thesis advances the idea that technological growth varies exponentially with respect to productivity. Solow's "remaining value" is used to calculate the pace of technological change that is given by,

$$
\frac{ΔA}{A}=\frac{ΔY}{Y}− 𝛼\frac{ΔK}{K} − 𝛽\frac{ΔL}{L}
$$

A least squares estimation might be used to remove the effect of non-technological parameters’ progress and other factors such as random inflation. It is very evident that it is difficult to obtain the other factors through the “remaining value” function (Alani 2012). However, we evaluate the calculated ‘A’ with the TFP values for the respective countries and examine the relation between them. This tells us if the TFP or the “remaining value” is actually the technological parameter. In the demand side, manufacturers would tend to lower their labour demand and they would like to create the same amount of production with less labour because labour productivity has improved in order to gain more income (Lindenberger 2003). Workers enjoy more leisure when their wages hit the ideal amount for a comfortable standard of living, while higher wage prices provide a disincentive for working longer hours (Koutsoyiannis 1979). As a result, employers would consider it fair to work fewer hours to achieve the same amount of production if their productivity had improved (Alani 2012). Also, production decreases as efficiency increases, resulting in an inverse relationship between productivity and output.

$$
\frac{ΔY}{ΔK}= (\frac{−𝛼}{1 − 𝛼 − 𝛽})(\frac{𝑌^{1+ 𝛼 + 𝛽}}{𝐾})
$$
Capital Productivity

$$
\frac{ΔY}{ΔL}= (\frac{−𝛼}{1 − 𝛼 − 𝛽})(\frac{𝑌^{1+ 𝛼 + 𝛽}}{L})
$$
Labour Productivity

We have theoretical assumptions and empirical studies suggesting a decrease in returns to scale based on labour and capital productivity i.e., `0 < 𝛼 +𝛽 < 1`

Theories of Capital and labour productivity derive an output function with respect to increase in respective productivities. Substituting the labour and capital productivity in place of capital and labour growth in Cobb-Douglass function will enable us to evaluate the effects on economic growth (Alani 2012).After relevant substitutions, data was gathered directly for capital and labour productivities, the per capita gross domestic products, and the total factor productivity for Euro region and the G7 nations (Bergeaud et al. 2019). 

## 3.4 The data

| Pages     | Series Name | Units     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| LP      | Labour productivity  | $US 2010 ppp per hours   |
| TFP   | Total Factor Productivity  | $US 2010 ppp based      |
| KI    | Capital Intensity  | $US 2010 ppp per hours  |
| GDP pc   | Gross Domestic Product per capita | $US 2010 ppp per persons  |


Our key dataset is the one used by (Bergeaud et al. 2019), and it is based on the work of (Cette et al. 016) and (Bergeaud et al. 2018), which collected data for 17 OECD countries from 1890 to 2019. These countries were selected based on their economic importance: the G7 (the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Canada), five other eurozone countries (Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and Finland), and five other countries that account for a large share of global GDP at any point during our time span or have a particular interest in terms of productivity (Australia, Switzer- land, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway). In comparison, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and Finland have reformed the Eurozone. This approximation seems to be acceptable given that these eight countries accounted for 93.2 percent of Eurozone GDP in 2010. The year 1890 was selected as the starting point in order to provide a sufficiently long time series to initialize our capital stock (Alani 2012). However, for our study we chose, 2 group of countries: The G7 nations and the nations grouped as Euro area. The reason was to develop a comparison of technological growth and investment with respect to economic growth over 130 years (De la Escosura 2015). We used series constructed by economists and historians on clear assumptions for long aggregate historical results. Many of these data are subject to confusion and inaccuracy, not just for distant but also for recent times. The data was compiled at the country level under the assumption of constant boundaries, in their most recent condition (Alani 2012). One critical factor in answering these questions is quantifying the impact of conventional growth factors (capital, labour) when accounting for their efficiency, but beyond this growth accounting exercise, delving deeper into the role of General-Purpose Technologies (GPT) in long-term growth. Development accounting (Kenton 2000) was the first effort to explore the relative functions of output factors, but it failed to explain the majority of twentieth-century growth, which was due to total factor productivity (TFP), the residual of this decomposition. This notion of TFP being related to technology is largely because it is hard to capture the effects of other residual factors affecting economic growth. In our next section let us look at the framework used in this study, and the process and methodology used to develop it. However, we have already established a firm base in section 3.3 assuming the replacements of capital growth and labour growth by capital intensity and labour productivity as a basis of our model. At this point, the a priori assumptions shall be an increase in returns to scale with respect to technological progress, and a decrease in returns to scale with respect to labour and capital productivity. 

# 4. Methodology and framework
After evaluating a number of econometric models, Jimmy Alani hypothesized the actual level of echnological progress that could have increased economic growth (Alani 2012). However, the capital labour productivity growth seemed to reduce the economic growth. An initial regression of Y running on capital input K and Labour input L gives us α and β values. Using these values, we can calculate the value of technology parameter. 

Further we model the level of technology or the technology factor using the formula

$$
𝐴 =\frac{𝑌}{𝐾^𝛼𝐿^𝛽}
$$

Relevant regressions were performed, and real level of technology’s value was calculated, assuming the coefficient of the level of technology (λ) is equal to 1. Our alternative hypothesis was `λ≠1`. 

By using the above capital productivity and labour productivity equations and econometric model hypothesized by (Alani 2012) that real technological development could have enhanced economic growth, while capital and labour productivity growth could have decreased economic growth. This equation is given by 

Two groups of countries were selected to perform a comparative study. Both being highly advanced group of nations, where some countries are a part of both the groups. However, we evaluate these nations as a group economy for the basis of this study. 

$$
\frac{ΔY}{(𝑌−1)} = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1\frac{(ΔAa)}{(Aa−1)} − 𝛽2\frac{(ΔK)}{(𝐾−1)} − 𝛽3\frac{(ΔL)}{(𝐿−1)} + 𝜀
$$ 
 
Where `𝛽0 = 0, 𝛽1 = 1, 0 < 𝛽2 < 1, 0 < 𝛽3 < 1` 

However, we will not be running regressions on this equation, as this is relative change in variables, we only shall look at the previous equation for the purpose of this current study. Estimation strategy for TFP used by (Bergeaud et al. 2019) is keeping the alpha at a constant 0.3. With alpha = 0.3, the global share of wealth, is believed to be invariant and constant over all countries. We shall notice further that this value is not equal to the estimated value of coefficients. Hence, to calculate the technological parameter we shall first run a regression on Y (The economic growth) using both capital intensity (K) and Labour productivity (L). The resulting α and β values shall be used to generate ‘A’ the technological parameter. Since our series begins in 1890, we do not cover the entire first industrial revolution, which was already waning in many countries by the end of the nineteenth century. As a result, we begin our series in 1905, including in our estimations. For a longer series, we may have selected other general-purpose inventions to concentrate on in the second half of the 19th century, such as the steam engine or railways (Bergeaud et al. 2018). We answer these questions by examining productivity growth drivers in the twentieth century. To begin, productivity, and more specifically TFP, has been the primary contributor to 20th-century development. Since TFP is calculated as a residual of a growth decomposition equation (Greasley and Madsen 2017), there is often the possibility that output factors were determined incorrectly, which leads to ascribe too much weight to TFP in growth dynamics.


# 5. Discussion

## 5.1 Initial model for Euro area and G7 countries

Our first model is run on Y (GDP) with K (capital productivity/intensity) and L (labour productivity), assuming the technological factor is a constant. The following observations were recorded. We are directly running a log model since a high multicollinearity is evident by theory. 


**Euro 1. Base model:** `lm(log(gdp_eu) ~ log(cap_eu) + log(lab_eu), data = GDP)`

Standard errors: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

| | Est. | S.E. | t val. | p |
| (Intercept) |7.42 | 0.07 | 107.11 | 0.00 |
| log(cap_eu) | -0.05 | 0.06 | -0.95 | 0.34 |
| log(lab_eu) | 0.83 | 0.06 | 14.26 | 0.00 |

The α and β values obtained are -0.05 and 0.83. However, the **R-squared: 0.9975** that suggests the presence of multicollinearity among the variables. 

**Euro 2. Multicollinearity check** 

Overall Multicollinearity Diagnostics 

| | MC Results | detection |
| Determinant mag(X'X) |0.0120 | 0 |
| Farrar Chi-Square | 563.4811 | 1 |
| Red Indicator | 0.9940| 1 |
| Sum of Lambda Inverse | 166.1028 | 1 |
| Theil's Method |0.9845 | 1 |
| Condition Number | 75.5935 | 1 |

`1 --> COLLINEARITY is detected by the test`  
`0 --> COLLINEARITY is not detected by the test`

A clear presence of collinearity is seen with a variety of tests. Looking at the returns to scale `𝛾 = 𝜆 +𝛼 + 𝛽` considering `𝜆 = 1` we get `𝛾 = 1.78`, but looking at the intercept it is clear that the returns to scale `𝛾 = 8.2`, hence `λ≠1`. 

*Hypothesis evaluation*  
The above result tells us the actual levels of technology is higher than the empirical assumptions of the technology factor. Hence we can successfully reject the null hypothesis that the independent variables contributing nothing to the economic growth and go further with assumption of capital and labour productivities contributing to economic growth. However, positive, or negative will be discussed later. 

**G7 1. Base model:** `lm(log(gdp_g7) ~ log(cap_g7) + log(lab_g7), data = G7)`

Standard errors: OLS

| | Est. | S.E. | t val. | p |
|(Intercept)| 7.19 | 0.06 | 115.54 | 0.00 |
|log(cap_g7) | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.97 | 0.34 |
|log(lab_g7) | 0.79 | 0.05 | 17.01 | 0.00 |

The α and β values obtained are 0.05 and 0.79. However, the **R-squared: 0.9914** that suggests the presence of multicollinearity among the variables. 

**G7 2. Multicollinearity check**

Overall Multicollinearity Diagnostics

| | MC Results | detection |
| Determinant mag(X'X) | 0.0222 | 0 |
| Farrar Chi-Square | 485.6968 | 1 |
| Red Indicator | 0.9889 | 1 |
| Sum of Lambda Inverse | 90.2455 | 1 |
| Theil's Method | 0.9643 | 1 |
| Condition Number | 61.1666 | 1 |

`1 --> COLLINEARITY is detected by the test`  
`0 --> COLLINEARITY is not detected by the test`

Once again, a clear presence of collinearity is seen with a variety of tests. The returns to scale also suggest that `λ≠1`

*Hypothesis evaluation*  
The above result again tells us the actual levels of technology is higher than the empirical assumptions of the technology factor. Hence we can successfully reject the null hypothesis that the independent variables contributing nothing to the economic growth and go further with assumption of capital and labour productivities contributing to economic growth. However, positive, or negative will be discussed later. 

*Inference*  
1% rise in the amount of technology, capital, and labour resulted in a ~7.5, ±0.05, and ~0.8 percent increase in productivity, respectively (or economic growth) in both Euro and G7 nations. The findings revealed that these advanced nations have been producing goods and services under declining returns to scale since α+ β < 1. Furthermore, the result show that advanced nations would increase production faster if they invested more in acquisition and utilization of the relevant technologies. Hence, our aim now is to first find the technology factor and model the technology progress value.

## 5.2 Level of technology function

To start off, we use the above obtained α and β values to calculate level of technology or the technology factor using the formula $$𝐴=\frac{𝑌}{𝐾^𝛼𝐿^𝛽}$$ .Once the values of ‘A’ are found for both euro area and G7 nations, we perform further regressions to evaluate the effect of ‘A’ relative to the calculated TFP.

**Euro 3. Tech model:** 

`lm(log(A) ~ log(gdp_eu) − log(cap_eu) − log(lab_eu), data = GDP)`

Standard errors: OLS

| | Est. | S.E. | t val. | p |
| (Intercept) | -8.24 | 0.09 | -92.45 | 0.00 |
| log(gdp_eu) | 2.13 | 0.01 | 226.70 | 0.00 |

**G7 3. Tech model:** 

`lm(log(A_) ~ log(gdp_g7) − log(cap_g7) − log(lab_g7), data = G7)`

Standard errors: OLS

| | Est. | S.E. | t val. | p |
| (Intercept) | -6.44 | 0.07 | -90.98 | 0.00 |
| log(gdp_g7) | 1.88 | 0.01 | 253.90 | 0.00 |

These models clearly shows and exponential relationship between the technological factor and the GDP growth, as the co-efficient of GDP being 2.13 and 1.88 for Euro and G7 nations, respectively. However, this clearly neglects the effects of capital and labour which is seen as negative effect based on the intercepts being negative. Let us look at the obtained technological factor value and the calculated total factor productivity for Euro region.

<div class="caption">
     Economic growth based on the “remaining value” out of which technology is a major contributor for Euro.
</div>

A sudden exponential increase in the GDP can be seen around the year 1945. This is a perfect implication of advanced Nations investing in technologies during the world war (Wikipedia 2021), and the industrial revolution adding to it. The above graphs are clearly indicating a similar relationship, which forces us to believe the “remaining value” is in fact the technological progress factor or the level of technology factor. This is also a strong suggestions of many economists (TINBERGEN 1964). However, this model is too perfect with a R-squared of 1. Moreover, there will not be any multicollinearity issues as there is only one variable practically affecting the change. Hence we can check for a brief autocorrelation with an assumption that it does not exist. 

**Durbin-Watson Tests (Euro and G7)**

| Durbin-Watson test | Durbin-Watson test |
| data: model2 | data: gmodel2 |
| DW = 0.32241, p-value < 2.2e-16 | DW = 0.25852, p-value < 2.2e-16 |
| alternative hypothesis: true au | alternative hypothesis: true au |
| tocorrelation is greater than 0 | tocorrelation is greater than 0 |
| EURO | G7 |

The initial D-W test shows the existence of a slight autocorrelation. Let us evaluate it further and try to fix it. 

**Autocorrelation handling**

| EURO | G7 |
| Did not converge | Durbin-Watson statistic |
| | (original): 0.25852 , p-value: 2.859e-24 |
| | (transformed): 2.48258 , p-value: 9.967e-01 |

Interesting observation! Though both these advanced group of nations are reacting similar to the change in input variables, the G7 nations show a significant autocorrelation. This is telling that there is relationship between technological growth of G7 nations in terms of current and past growth.

<div class="caption">
    Economic growth based on technological progress for G7 nations.  
</div>


To summarize, we can say that the G7 nations started investing in technology a few years earlier in advanced technology than the Euro nations. This can be clearly seen from Figure 2. Hence, after adjusting the autocorrelation factor the new co-efficient for the G7 nations tech equation will be 

Standard errors: OLS

| | Est. | S.E. | t val. | p |
|(Intercept)| -6.44 | 0.07 | -90.98 | 0.00 |
|log(gdp_g7) | 1.88 | 0.01 | 253.90 | 0.00 |

*Inference*  
Strong implications can be found here that the economic growth cannot be accurately modelled with just ‘A’ as the technological factor. As seen in the literature survey, a progress factor ΔA will be necessary to develop the technological level function. Moreover, a perfect R- squared is clearly because the dependent variable was calculated using the exact α and β values, whereas the TFP is calculated by keeping α at constant 0.3 across all the nations and β value to be 1 – α (Bergeaud et al. 2018). We discovered that a 1% rise in technical development could more than double production if it were followed by improvements in capital and labour productivity. However, the labour and capital factors are neglected in our previous model as their inclusion only gave coefficient of technology factor around 1.

Standard errors: OLS

| | Est. | S.E. | t val. | p |
| (Intercept) | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.18 |  0.86 |
|log(gdp_eu) | 1.00 | 0.00 | 546173117647673.00 | 0.00 |
|log(cap_eu) | 0.05 | 0.00 | 45791245240579.40 | 0.00 |
|log(lab_eu) | 0.83 | 0.00 | 428515092004297.00 | 0.00 |

Huge t-values on inclusion of all the variables however suggest us to reject the null hypothesis that individually or collectively, the contributing factors have no effect on economic growth. Furthermore, this inclusion model says that, increase in technology increases economic growth in equal proportion, but increase in labour and capital productivity decreases the economic growth, and a huge collinearity is seen between labour and capital. The same inference is to be found with the G7 countries as well. Nevertheless, it is evident (see Figure 1) that increase in technology will exponentially increase the economic growth and capital and labour productivity does not contribute to this growth in a positive way. So, before we study better models, lets us look at our previous models for both Euro and G7 nations, in depth. To do this, we look at residual analysis of aforementioned models for both Euro and GDP nations. Residuals are the variations between the model's one-step expected performance and the observed output from the validation data collection. As a result, residuals reflect the part of the validation data that the model does not describe (MathWorks Australia 2016).

## 5.3 Analysis of all the previous models
Let us first take a look at the residuals of our models. By this, we can estimate the influence of the residuals and evaluate the quality of the model variables.

     Residual analysis for all the models.  
</div>

As seen in the top-left and bottom-left plots in each of the 4 models, the red line in our case is very marginally bent, and the residuals seem to be evenly distributed as the fitted Y values rise. As a result, the assumption here is that heteroscedasticity does not happen since the chaos seems to be regulated as years pass by. The distribution of uniform residuals, however, varies as the leverage, or exposure of the fitted output to a change in input is varied. In our base models, a clustered influence of all the residuals can be seen without many outliers. This can be based that, Total factor productivity did not consider technology alone, but a number of other factors lumped together as “remaining value”. However, in our tech models, we can see equal distribution of residual influence throughout the years, which tells us that our technological factor is the major reason for economic growth in these advanced nations.

# 6. Results and further research

- The technological impact on the economic growth is very evident and it could have caused an exponential growth in the GDP. 

- The Technological factor influence and the TFP or the “remaining value” influence seem to be very similar. This suggests that a major part of the TFP is the technological boom during certain points in history, for example, the world war and industrial revolution. Figure 3 helps us to notice this differentiation very well, while examining the residual influence plots for TFP and technological factor equations. 

- The above results were seen common among both the groups of advanced nations; however, an interesting conclusion was arrived in the time of technology adaptation. The G7 nations seem to have invested in the advanced technologies a few years earlier than the euro group nations, as evident from Figures 1 and 2.

- A theoretical research and empirical study of the capital and labour factors implicate that as capital and labour productivity increases, the economy decreases. According to research (Alani 2012)a, this is found to be due to the adaptation of leisure with a stable economy among the workforce. A further research could be the analysis of the equation of focus as discussed in section 4. 

$$
\frac{ΔY}{𝑌−1}= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1\frac{ΔAa}{Aa−1} − 𝛽2\frac{ΔK}{𝐾−1}− 𝛽3\frac{ΔL}{𝐿−1} 
$$

This will allow us to look at more contributing factors and also the modification of currently involved factors. For example, ‘the age of capital’ is very good measure to examine the effects on GDP. As per (Kisch and Henderson 1982) age of capital is just the vintage effect on the capital, that is older capital is less productive than the new capital. Furthermore, the diffusion of technology can be considered as an interesting observation was found in this study, the availability of technology in different areas can be considered for a better estimation.

# 7. Conclusion 

Econometric research made on advanced nations over a 130-year period from 1890 to 2019 came up with following findings; 1) Growth in Technological progress results in increased economy and growth in capital and labour productivity decreases the economic growth. 2) However, most of the findings were same across the two sample sets of nations, G7 and Euro, the G7 nations seemed to have adapted the technology earlier than Euro group of nations. 3) Value of Technology is a major factor in TFP, but its subject to technology diffusion. Most of the a priori assumptions were proved right, and an interesting observation was recorded with G7 nations. Autocorrelation was detected which implied a vague repetition of the relative past events (in terms of technology adaptation). The study concluded by a positive closure and further developments in modified and/or new variables.

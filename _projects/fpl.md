# Summary

Currently documenting the idea. Based on the data collected from [FPL-Analytics](https://www.fplanalytics.com/) and news descriptions (for sentiment analysis) from twitter and instagram, an algorithm is currently being developed to predicted the points scored in the upcoming gameweek of the top 50 players in the english premier league football.  

The idea is to develop a number of solutions such as - best transfer (each week), best full team selection (week1 and wildcard), best captain pick etc
